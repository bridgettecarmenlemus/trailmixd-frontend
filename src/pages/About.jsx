      <h2>Welcome to Trailmix'd!</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for visiting the website. My name is Bridgette and I am
        currently a software engineering student at Boca Code. Beyond being a
        full time student, I love going on hiking trips. So, it is with great
        pleasure that I have created this site where hikers could come here and
        review there latest hike.{" "}
